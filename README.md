Here to do some business with some C# on our hips


Running Off unity version 2019.1.9f




PLAYER CONTROLLS:

There are 4 main action you can do to control the player in the demo:


1. Touching the left and right arrows on either side of the screen will move the player in the desire direction
2. Touching The bottom third of the screen is the Jump button which I have labelled, but usually the in the final version the arrows and      text on the UI would not be visible. THE PLAYER DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE JUMP.
3. Swiping Right, Left, Up and Down will register different commands used for the player power-ups.
4. Swipe right to use the ice power up.


PC CONTROLS:

D - Move Right,
A - Move Left,
SPACE - Jump,
Mouse Drag Right : Use Ice power-up

STAGE HAZARDS:

Use the Ice power-up to create a layer of Ice over the hot springs. The Steam from the hot springs as well as the icicles that fall from the ceiling can damage the player.
